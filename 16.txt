My algorithm pairs two or three people, depending on the situation, in groups based on how similar their ratings on movies were compared to the other people in our dataset. To measure the similarity between our users, I made use of the Pearson correlation. In my opinion only ratings that were actually made by the users should be taken into consideration, which Pearson correlation exactly did. Therefore this was in my opinion the best measurement for similarity in this situation. After that we apply Greedy algorithm after sorting the pairs based on similarity: take the top pair, delete all the entries in which one of the top pair users is involved and repeat. If three people are left in the end, they form a pair.
