This pairing algorithm uses top the edge adjusted cosine similarity to compute the best pairs with highest similarity rate. It is guaranteed to pair items / people to the ones they are most likely to be similar with. When pairing is not possible due to an odd numbers of students, the script after execution will inform you that one pair is not able to be made because there is only one student left. It is then up to the human to resolve this matter.
