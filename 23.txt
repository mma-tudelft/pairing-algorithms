This is an easy but effective way to get the closest pairs. All the groups are formed with the best pair, only the group of three persons isnâ€™t formed correctly, the last person is added to the group that was formed as latest. To get the closest pairs I use the euclidean distace between different vectors, but first the vectors are normalised. This is done by dividing every value by the max value in the list. At the end there is a list of pairs with numbers, these numbers are equal to a name in the vector keys.
