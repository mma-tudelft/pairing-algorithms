The pairing algorithm computes the Pearson correlation for all possible combinations of students. All the movies a student has not rated will not be taken into account, therefore, the score for a possible match will only be based on movies both students have watched and give a better indication if they like the same movies equally. Students are matched on decreasing order of the correlation: available students with the highest correlation are matched first. In case of an uneven number of students the remaining student is matched with the pair with the highest average of the correlations with each individual student of the original pair with the remaining student: this will give a match which cannot include a low correlation for only one of the members.
