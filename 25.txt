This algorithm uses the adjusted cosine similarity function to calculate for each pair of users their similarity. It takes into account the variance in user rating habits by taking mean-centered vectors. Since the adjusted cosine similarity function also measures over unrated items, possible pairs who have both not rated an item are more likely to be matched than a pair where one has rated the item and the other hasnâ€™t. This results in more accurate matching as not rating an item also implicitly reveals information about the user. They would probably know the item if it was of any interest.
