My algorithm tries to find pairs of people who both have their highest correlation with one another, only based on the movies that one or both of them watched. If such a pair can't be made, the two people with the highest correlation are paired together. The correlation is calculated with the adjusted cosine similarity because I find it to work the most accurate compared to the other similarity measurements. If there is an odd number of people, the person with the lowest correlation with anyone is matched to the pair where they match the best.
