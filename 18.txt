This algorithm calculates the adjusted cosine similarity between every possible pair. 
After sorting the pairs on similarity, it iterates over the pairs and picks the pairs with the highest similarity in a greedy way. 
In the instance that there is an odd amount of participants, this algorithm iterates over all the pairs in order of descending similarity and looks for a pair that contains the remaining participant. 
Once this pair has been found, the last participant is added to the matched pair belonging to the other member of the found pair.
This creates one trio in which the one member shares a relatively high similarity with the other two members and because of this it is likely that the other two members also have a relatively high similarity.
