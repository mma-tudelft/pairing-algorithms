The algorithm takes the ratings of all users for all items and adjust the ratings by subtracting the average rating for each of the items. It then calculate the adjusted cosine based on just the values two users have in common. The list of adjusted cosines is sorted and the sorted list is used to generate pairs. Because the algorithm uses adjusted values opinions that differ largely from the general consensus have a greater influence on the output, which ensures users are less likely to end up with users that hate the thing they like and vice versa.
