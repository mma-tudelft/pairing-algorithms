Below I will show you, why my algorithm for pairing is the best algorithm:

The total algorithm has three major components: the computation of the score between two users, the pairing of the all the users based on those scores and the component of dealing with odd amounts of users.

The scoring uses the taxicab distance on the set of movies where both users have rated the movie not 0. It then takes take the average of that to express the average difference between the ratings of two users on movies they have both rated.

The pairing is then done with the greedy algorithm as seen in the assignment.

If there is an odd amount of students, it will notify who the leftover student is and suggest a pair of students who match really well with the leftover student.

The total algorithm is simple, which I think is the most important feature of all here. An algorithm for this kind of problem shouldnâ€™t have the most difficult scoring system. Because it is simple, it is also fast! Finally, the algorithm works great, people will find the right partner. Therefore, everyone should vote on this algorithm!
