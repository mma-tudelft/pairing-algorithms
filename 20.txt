For the algorithm I used the pearson correlation function. 
I chose this similarity function over the others because it is used very often. 
The algorithm uses a very basic greedy algorithm that takes the two most correlated students and matches them together. 
After they’re matched, the students are removed from the list and the algorithm reruns. 
When there’s an odd number of students, I applied the standard educational practice to group the last three students. 
The advantages of the approach that the greedy algorithm takes is that the biggest group of people are satisfied and roughly only the last three student are less satisfied.
