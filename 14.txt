This algorithm starts by reading all the names, identifiers and scores from the “.csv” file. It then calculates the adjusted cosine similarity for each possible non-repeating pair’s scores, then calculating the deviance from the global cosine similarity average (average of everyone’s cosine similarity) for each of those pairs. It then selects the pairs with the least deviance, based on a greedy approach (which we can see failed slightly for the last case). This method has the advantage that, overall, everyone should be paired with someone with a similar amount of likes and dislikes, instead of a few people being paired with people with very similar taste in movies, and the remaining being successively paired with people with less commonly liked movies.
