To make pairs based on their preferences I used the Euclidian distance to calculate a score between students. Students who rate a movie with 5 starts should get a high penalty with students with only 1 star. This penalty should be significantly larger than comparing with a student who rated 4 stars. This is why the Euclidian distance is useful. I modified it a bit for when students rated a movie with a 0. In this case the square gives a too high penalty. So the penalty is not squared in this case.
